Structure:
Basketball.asm    reverse-engineered file
makefile          Makefile to build code
tia_constants.h   header file containing constants for the TIA

The reverse-engineered file uses standard MACRO.H and VCS.H header files. These
are not supplied. They can be found with the distribution of DASM cross
assembler.

Build notes:
I included an option to build a PAL60 version of this game. This will use the
color palette of the PAL50 region but produce a frame rate of 60 FPS.
