Structure:
ET.asm                  reverse-engineered file
makefile                Makefile to build code
tia_constants.h         header file containing constants for the TIA

The reverse-engineered file uses standard VCS.H header files. This is not
supplied. It can be found with the distribution of the DASM cross assembler.
